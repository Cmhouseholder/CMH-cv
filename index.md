`Expected 2026`
__University of Maryland, College Park, MD__
- Ph.D. in Biological Sciences - Molecular & Cellular Biology

`2021`
__Roanoke College, Salem, VA__
- B.S. in Biology 
- *magna cum laude* 

## Relevant Coursework

Biology of Vision, Genetics, Cell Biology, Statistics and Modeling for Biologists, Molecular Biology, Gene Expression, Evolution, General Physics, General Chemistry (I&II), Organic Chemistry (I&II), Biochemistry I, Genetic Analysis, Nucleic Acids I, Cell Biology: Structure and Function, Immunology, Tropical Marine Biology (Baja, Mexico). 

## Research Experience: 

`2023-Present`
__Graduate Research Assistant__
 - *Dr. Juan Angueyra-Artizabal, Department of Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD*
- Characterized the transcriptional regulation of retinal progenitor cells mediated through two transcription factors, tbx2a & tbx2b in Danio rerio. 

`2022-2023 `
__Graduate Research Assistant__
- *Dr. William R Jeffery, Department of Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD*
- Analyzed the effects of hypoxia on the reversal of visceral heart asymmetry during early development in *Astyanax mexicanus*. 



`2018-2021`
__Undergraduate Research Assistant__
- *Dr. Leonard Pysh, Department of Biology, Roanoke College, Salem, VA*
- Analyzed Lignin gene expression of transcriptional reporter lines of in the roots of cellulose deficient Arabidopsis plants. Discovered that roots grown in light had increased transcripts of monolignol synthesis genes and hypothesized to be a defense mechanism for _A. thaliana_.
