## Research Experience: 

`Jan 2023-Present`
__Graduate Research Assistant__
 - *Dr. Juan Angueyra-Artizabal, Department of Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD*
- Characterized the transcriptional regulation of retinal progenitor cells mediated through two transcription factors, tbx2a & tbx2b in Danio rerio. 

`Jan 2022-December 2023 `
__Graduate Research Assistant__
- *Dr. William R Jeffery, Department of Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD*
- Analyzed the effects of hypoxia on the reversal of visceral heart asymmetry during early development in *Astyanax mexicanus*. 



`Spring 2018-May 2021`
__Undergraduate Research Assistant__
- *Dr. Leonard Pysh, Department of Biology, Roanoke College, Salem, VA*
- Analyzed Lignin gene expression of transcriptional reporter lines of in the roots of cellulose deficient Arabidopsis plants. Discovered that roots grown in light had increased transcripts of monolignol synthesis genes and hypothesized to be a defense mechanism for _A. thaliana_.
