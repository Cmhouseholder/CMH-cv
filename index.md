## Research Experience

`2023-Present`
__Graduate Research Assistant__
 - *Dr. Juan Angueyra, Department of Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD*
- Characterized the transcriptional regulation of retinal progenitor cells mediated through two transcription factors, _tbx2a_ & _tbx2b_ in Danio rerio.
